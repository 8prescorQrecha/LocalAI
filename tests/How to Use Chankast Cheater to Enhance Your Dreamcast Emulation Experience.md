# How to Use Chankast Cheater to Enhance Your Dreamcast Emulation Experience
  
If you are a fan of the Sega Dreamcast console and want to play its games on your PC, you might have heard of Chankast, one of the first emulators that could run commercial games. However, Chankast is not very user-friendly and has some compatibility issues with newer operating systems and hardware. Moreover, it does not have a built-in cheat function, which can be useful for unlocking hidden features, skipping difficult levels, or just having fun.

Fortunately, there is a solution: Chankast Cheater. This is a utility that allows you to use cheat codes with Chankast emulator. It works by modifying the memory of the emulator while it is running, so you can change various aspects of the game such as health, ammo, score, etc. You can also search for your own cheats using the scan function.
  
In this article, we will show you how to install and use Chankast Cheater with Chankast emulator. You will need the following files:
  
- Chankast emulator (version 0.25 or higher)
- Chankast Cheater (version 0.2a or higher)

## Step 1: Install Chankast emulator
  
Extract the Chankast emulator zip file to a folder of your choice. You should see two executable files: chankast.exe and chanka.exe. The first one is the main emulator, while the second one is a launcher that lets you configure some settings such as video, audio, input, etc.
  
Run chanka.exe and go to Options > Configure. Here you can set up your preferences for the emulator. For example, you can choose your video plugin (DirectX or OpenGL), resolution, sound quality, controller type (keyboard or gamepad), etc. You can also enable or disable some features such as VMS manager (for saving games), force feedback (for vibration), region (for compatibility), etc.
  
After you are done with the configuration, click OK and close chanka.exe.
  
## Step 2: Install Chankast Cheater
  
Extract the Chankast Cheater zip file to the same folder where you installed Chankast emulator. You should see a file called chankastcheater.exe. This is the main utility that will let you use cheat codes with Chankast.
  
Run chankastcheater.exe and click on File > Open Cheat Database. Here you can browse and select a cheat database file that contains cheat codes for various Dreamcast games. You can download some cheat database files from [here](https://www.epforums.org/showthread.php?105483-Chankast-Cheater). Alternatively, you can create your own cheat database file using a text editor such as Notepad.
  
A cheat database file has a .cht extension and consists of sections for each game. Each section starts with a line that contains the game name and its CRC value (a unique identifier for each game). Then it lists the cheat codes for that game, one per line. Each cheat code has a name, an address, a value, and an optional comment. For example:

    [Sonic Adventure 2 (USA) - CRC: 0x89F2B1A1]
    Infinite Rings
    0x8C4D4E34
    0x00000063
    #This code gives you 99 rings
    
    Infinite Lives
    0x8C4D4E30
    0x00000009
    #This code gives you 9 lives

After you have selected a cheat database file, click OK and go back to the
